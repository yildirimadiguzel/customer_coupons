# Coupon Acceptance Analysis

## Summary of Findings
This project analyzes the factors influencing the acceptance of coupons by drivers based on various attributes such as age, income, marital status, and habits (e.g., bar visits, restaurant visits). The key findings include:

1. Drivers who frequent bars more than once a month are more likely to accept bar coupons.
2. Younger drivers (under 30) and those who are not widowed show a higher likelihood of accepting bar coupons.
3. Drivers with lower income and frequent visits to cheap restaurants are more inclined to accept coupons.
4. Social habits, age, and lifestyle factors significantly influence coupon acceptance.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook**: [Coupon Acceptance Analysis Notebook](./prompt.ipynb)
- **Visualizations**: Includes bar plots, histograms, and acceptance rate comparisons.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
